# Project Status: In Development

This project is still in the development phase. Here, you will find the source code for:

- **ETL and Machine Learning pipelines**
- **Smartwatch app code**
- **Server code (AWS Lambda)**

## Project Overview
This project aims to capture user activities by collecting movement data through a smartwatch's sensors. Specifically, the following activities will be classified using the accelerometer and gyroscope with Machine Learning models:

- Writing ✍️
- Drawing 🎨
- Typing ⌨️
- Hand up ✋
- Sitting 🪑
- Standing 🚶
- Walking 🚶‍♂️
- Clapping 👏
- Eating 🍽️
- Drinking 🥤

Additionally, a study will compare accuracy between models trained on external datasets and real-user data, exploring the potential of using new trials to enhance model performance.

Finally, the smartwatch app will enable users to:
- Record a session
- View real-time classification results
- Review and delete recorded sessions if desired
